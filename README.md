# Software Development Course Assignments

This repository contains all assignments and projects completed during my software development course journey.

## Course Structure

### Completed Courses
- **Programming with Objects - Completed - August 2025**
  - Location: 'Python Course/'
  - Description: This course builds on structured programming and introduces object-oriented and functional programming concepts. Students design, code, test and document business-oriented solutions using complex algorithms. Advanced topics include the use of libraries for data manipulation and visualization.
- **C# Course** - Completed - October 2025**
  - Location: `C# Course/`
  - Description: This course explores structured and object-oriented program development. Topics include language syntax, selection and iteration control structures, functions, debugger tools and techniques, objects, classes, encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance.
